<p>This emoji also has a sister emoji with crossed out eyes but no teeth showing, and that you use when you’re about to pass out. Click up or down to vote on entries! It’s important to note that if the eyes are closed or squinted the top eyelashes will need to be drawn further down from the horizontal line in the example.
