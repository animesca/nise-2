<p>The Sunday episode labeled the program The Dangers of Teen TV Series. A nime review for Attack on Titan a project based on the Kodansha-published manga by Hajime Isayama and first published on September 9 2009Let me just start by saying this the first Anime Ive really watched from the start Ive seen a few episodes of random Anime here and there but often didnt know what the fuck was going on as it was like season 3. I watched Deathnote and Attack on Titan and I really enjoyed both of them. Light and L had grown fonder and fonder of each other after their tennis match they spend time together and friendship turns to love. Action Adventure Dark Fantasy.</p>
