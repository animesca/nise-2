<p>Black friday weekend is here! The summer anime season is upon us, bringing a handful of good series to our streaming doors. With good character designs and nice animation, this anime is good to watch, but the simple plot that tries hard to make parodies of many famous fairy tales does bring this anime down. In april 2020 the anime moved to saturdays. The spring season took a big hit and summer looks to be slimmed down this year, but there�s still plenty of gems to unearth.</p>
