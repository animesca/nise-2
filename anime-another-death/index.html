<p>Her cause of death is still unknown. It was so good. In 1972 a popular student in Yomiyama North Middle Schools class 3-3 named Misaki passed away during the school year. Horror is not a genre that in my opinion is well represented in anime. In the original novel she died of a sudden illness soon after Kouichi was born while in the manga and anime she died of unknown complications following thereafter. Based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Yukito Ayatsuji the series is set in 1998 and focuses on a boy named Kōichi Sakakibara who upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class facing gruesome and senseless deaths.</p>
