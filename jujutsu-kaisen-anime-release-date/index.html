<p>On november 25, 2019, it was announced that the anime series is in production. This assumes that there is no delay between now and then, as the world is in an unpredictable state right now. Jujutsu kaisen anime will start its premiere on october 3, 2020, along with the other anime scheduled to release this fall. An exact date is yet to be announced, however, it has been confirmed that jujutsu kaisen anime will premiere in october 2020. And now, the anime is all set to release on october 2, 2020.</p>
