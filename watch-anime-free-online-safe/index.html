<p>This anime website shows you the updated plot of the latest anime of the season. Crunchyroll is ofcourse the biggest and most popular one. I tested site using nordvpn, brave browser and ad blocker. The best part is that you do not need to register even for free. With a huge library, crunchyroll is worth the price and there is a free membership too but the popup ads will annoy and you would not be able to watch your favorite show peacefully.</p>
