<p>Tears were shed, fans were heartbroken (pretty sure we still are), and fellow supernatural stars and crew shared their sentiment. With season 13 of supernatural at our doorstep, variety looks back at all the previous seasons of sam and dean�s adventures to pick out the 25 best episodes. And if the series had ended with the season 5 finale, swan song, then the show could’ve had one of the best series finales ever, in my opinion, with a few adjustments.
