<p>A Wit-inspired animation - As Ashley An noted Wit studios made Attack on Titan a masterpiece. It was fun gave me the feels and some good thrills. 242 views last week. The biggest thing is that somehow AOT got the recognition of the general public what I mean by that is it was a show that was not only watched by anime viewers who were already pretty much immersed in the medium but also. Many tbhbut i agree AoT brought something new to the anime field Humans vs Man eating giants aka titansso here are the anime better than AoT or on the same level 1.</p>

<p>For any particular reason please stop when asked to do. Before we start I love Attack on Titan and it is one of my favorite series. Well for attack on titan you can use Historm anime app from which you can not only watch online but also download. In this episode Beast titan found out the hard way of what would happen if he underestimates levi Poor soul XD. There are some constantly saying use VPN but it doesnt work most of the time.</p>
