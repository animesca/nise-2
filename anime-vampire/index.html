<p>Top 45 Vampire Anime show list info I originally named this list top 50 because this is part of my top 50 genres of anime series but then after doing most of the list. Thankfully we can all easily stream even English dubbed vampire. The first episodes are confusing but things start to make sense and in one of the later episodes their is a vampire scene. Such is the case in Servamp. Rosario Vampire gives a new feel to the vampire anime genre.</p>
