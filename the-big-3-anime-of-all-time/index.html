<p>Onoda is a cheerful otaku looking to join his new school�s anime club, eager to finally make some friends. The big 3 were one piece, naruto and bleach, beginning in 2004 —thus, some consider the big 3 to refer to only those three series and the 2000s period of animanga fandom. They are naruto, bleach and one piece. This is one of the first great anime dubs, coming in a time where most were mediocre. His confidence, however, has grown and he fights with ore heart and resilience.</p>

<p>This list of �top 100 anime series of all time� will feature what i consider to be the 100 greatest anime series ever made. Although many great movies have come from american superpower businesses such as hollywood, warner brothers, and disney, japan has its fair share of cinematic masterpieces that should not be skipped over by movie enthusiasts. While all three of these series diverged pretty drastically in their methods, storytelling, and overall conclusions (or lack thereof with one piece), they also all sold. Awesome anime fights free from the limits of budget, safety, and the laws of physics are one of the big draws for the medium of anime. Pokémon is the most represented animated film franchise, with seven films on.</p>

<p>2012 is the most represented year on the list, with six films. Blah blah no one cares its okay if thats ur opinion but you guys dont understand this is not the best animes and btw after u watch a lot of anime like me ive been watching anime for 10 yrs you will. Top 25 best anime series of all time. The best anime dub of all time is cowboy bebop.
